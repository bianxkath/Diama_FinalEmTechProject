    <h1 class="header">Do you think we
        are desensitized
        by the amount of
        information that
        we consume? Why or why not?</h1>

   <div class="bp1"> 
    <p>Desensitization is a new word for me. It was my first time
    seeing this word and I donâ€™t even know what is means,
    not until I searched it. Based on my research,
    desensitization is a psychological process by which a
    response is repeatedly elicited in situations where the
    action tendency that arises out of the emotion proves to
    be irrelevant.</p>
<p>In today's world, we are constantly bombarded with
    information from various sources such as social media,
    news outlets, and the internet in general. It's
    understandable to ask if we are becoming desensitized to
    all of the information that is readily available to us. It is
    possible to view the abundance of information as a good thing. It enables us to keep up with current affairs
    and educate ourselves about them, and it can also give us a sense of connectedness to the world outside
    of us. However, there are also negative aspects to consider. It might be challenging to receive and
    comprehend all of the information that is presented to us at once. This may result in a sense of overwhelm
    and make it challenging to develop firm ideas or act on the information we receive.</p>
<p>Overall, it's important to be mindful of the information we consume and how it affects us. This might mean
    limiting our exposure to certain sources or taking breaks from social media. It's also important to fact-check
    information and critically evaluate what we read or hear to ensure that we don't become desensitized to
    important issues. It's like a two-sided coin whether the constant bombardment of information can make us
    desensitized or not. On one hand, it can keep us informed and connected, but on the other hand, it can
    lead to a feeling of being overwhelmed and can make it difficult to form strong opinions or take action on
    the information we receive. It's important to be mindful of the information we consume and how it affects us.</p></div>
