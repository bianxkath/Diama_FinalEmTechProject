    <p>We can not deny that nowadays, the media is a very powerful tool to the point that it can cause harm to us, users. We are
        constantly exposed on social media in this digital age. We can now easily use open platforms to post or share our ideas, thoughts,
        and even personal experiences with others. Unfortunately, this can result in harmful media such as hate speech, misinformation,
        explicit content, and other issues. As a result, it is critical to understand how we distinguish between "content" and harmful media.</p>

<p>Making a difference between content and harmful media is difficult, but it plays an important role in balancing the freedom to
    express and the protection of individuals from harm, which we must consider when placing limits.Social media's future is
    unknown. Although it is safe to assume that social media is not going away, it is constantly growing with new users all over the
    world. In today's society, social media is a multibillion-dollar industry. This multibillion-dollar industry protects users who
    express themselves through the use of a keyboard. While it is impossible to control the information spread via social media, it is
    possible to be cautious before spreading information. A social media user should read the articles and watch the videos, but keep
    in mind that the information presented may be true, untrue, or simply the opinion of another. Social media is now a powerful tool
    for social change for todayâ€™s society.</p></div>
